# stream-combos
Combinatorics functions that return streams

## Introduction
Problem solving steps can require generating subsets, combinations, or permutations of given items.
However, it may not be necessary or possible to generate all solutions at once and hold them in memory.

The included functions return solutions as streams which can be lazily filtered and processed.

## Install
Download the file and load it using CHICKEN Scheme.
